//Your proposal, including game description and storyboards
It’s a maze game where the player tries to find a treasure at the end. The maze represents my journey in life, although I often feel lost, I encounter valuable experiences that guide me toward my goal. Each wall and path symbolizes the uncertainty, hesitation, and discovery I’ve faced during my career journey.

Scene 1(hatching): A dinosaur hatches from an egg, representing a new beginning and curiosity about the unknown world.
Scene 2(maze): The player navigates through the maze, encountering small treasures that deliver encouraging messages.
Scene 3(ending): After collecting all treasures, the dinosaur finds the exit, symbolizing self-discovery and courage.


//Your assignment reflections
Although the gameplay seems simple, coding and implementing each feature was challenging. I got some help from ChatGPT during the process, but understanding and modifying the code on my own was also a difficult yet valuable experience. Through this project, I learned how interactive play can express personal emotions and how patience and persistence are essential in both design and life.
